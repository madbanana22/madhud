# madhud
A modern and simple hud for TF2.

# Install Instructions
Tip: Hover your mouse over [underlined text](## "Google en passant!") to see a popup! Try it!

1. [Download this repository as a ZIP](## "Code -> Download ZIP") (or git clone it whatever)
2. Navigate to your [tf/custom](## "Steam install directory/steamapps/common/Team Fortress 2/tf/custom") folder (if it's not there, just create it!)
3. Unzip the HUD there. The file tree should look like this:

<code> ╠ tf
\ ╚╦ custom
\ \ ╚╦ madhud
\ \ \╚╦ resource
\ \ \ ╠ scripts
\ \ \ ╠ readme.md
\ \ \ ╚ etc</code>

4. **Restart TF2**. `hud_reloadscheme` won't work because the game needs to find a new search path. (and because some font and material shenanigans are only performed on game launch)
